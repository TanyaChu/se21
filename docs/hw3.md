# Homework 3: Check on the Real Package 


Same as the Homework 2, you will work on another package which has been skimmed before by another student, and do the same thing. Cross-checking is a good way to maintain the reliability of the data labelled by real people.
  
- We will assign you a package which worked by other students in HW2. (Please don't look at result files submitted by previous students)
- Skim the papers in that package
- Find reused works in those papers
- Submit the reuse report in the required format just like in HW 2

## What to do
1. We will assign you a package! Please go to assigning sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v1_8isE1W_bezk5u9Y8O2k4MYPSok2gYH-XtWzqKdvk/edit#gid=0) and find your working package for HW3. 
  
2. In the Reuse GitHub Repo: https://github.com/bhermann/DoR, find the **issue** corresponds to your working package.
  
3. Now in that repo, please grab your packet from the [todo list](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/tree/main/workflow/todo) 
  
4. Same as Homework 2, please find the reuse in your package by following the [standard instruction](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md)
  
5. Report the reuse in a .csv file.
  
6. In the coding guide (https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md), please ignore the commenting steps in **coding instructing** since we will assign you both in homework 2 and homework 3. What you need to comment to your **issue** is only the result file.
 
  
## What to submit

- Prepare your DOR report in the required format (see the [sample csv](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/results-sample.csv))
- Name your report csv file **wp-XX-results.csv** (where XX refers to the work package id like "ae").
- Upload your report file to your **issue** by following the [standard instruction](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md).
- After you upload your csv file, in the central spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GmnStM4HUbiUdDkEwPvpXo21BRYcpHsjN_S_RSg1_Ic/edit#gid=0, paste the link of the issue you worked on (under the column `link to result`) and leave comment on some unnormal situation (under the column `comment`).
  
## Note
  
- Please submit **comma-separated values file (csv file)**!!! Submitting wrong file will cause you lose your points in that homework!!!
- Windows users may have issues when upload the csv file to the issue comment. If this happens, please add **.txt** at the end of your file name in your local machine (Your final file name should be something like **wp-xx-results.csv.txt**). This will solve your uploading problem.
