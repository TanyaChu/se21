# Homework 4: Gain Consistent Ideas on Reuse (Due on Oct. 7th 11:59pm)

In homework 2 and homework 3, you have experienced on finding reuse from one package, and re-evaluate another package. In software engineering, such cross validation is a good way to verify the data quality. Now, in homework 4, you will experience on finding reuse in software engineering with another partner, and get consistent knowledge for the package you are working on. 
  
- You will be assigned a new package with a partner.
- Skim the papers in that package INDIVIDUALLY first.
- Find reused works in those papers INDIVIDUALLY first, and record why you think it's a reuse for further reference.
- After you and your partner finish the package, gather together through Discord, email, Slack, etc. Spend like 30 minutes to discuss the reuse you find, and make consistent result with your partner.
- Submit the consistent result to Moodle.

## What to do
1. We will assign you a package and your partner! Please go to assigning sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Et5kzG3sfRMM3InX7aCjn1NLrnrrFfxwHT4QJ-1HGMw/edit#gid=0) and find your working package and your partner for HW4. 
  
2. In the same repo as HW2 and HW3, please grab your package from the [todo list](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/tree/main/workflow/todo) 
  
3. Same as HW2 and HW3, please find the reuse in your package by following the [standard instruction](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/coding_guide.md) (Please note that you need to do it individually first)
  
4. Report the reuse YOU FIND, and record your reason for discussion purpose.
  
5. Now if you and your partner both finished the package, select the best way to talk about your result. You need to argue why you think this is/is not a reuse, or accept your partner's opinion why it is/is not a reuse.
  
6. Record your consistent result in a new .csv file (This is the file you need to submit).
 
  
## What to submit

- Prepare your DOR report in the required format (see the [sample csv](https://github.com/bhermann/DoR/blob/main/workflow/results-sample.csv))
- Name your report csv file **wp-XX-results.csv** (where XX refers to the work package id like "ae").
- **This time, we will submit your homework to Moodle. Since 2 people will have 1 result file, only one of you needs to do the submission. Another teammate can leave the submission empty**.
- In Moodle, find the HW4 submission panel, and do the submission.
  
## Note
  
- Please submit **comma-separated values file (csv file)**!!! Submitting wrong file will cause you lose your points in that homework!!!
- Only 1 submission is needed for you and your partner, please discuss who will do the submission.
