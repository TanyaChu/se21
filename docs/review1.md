1. Fill in the above table.
2. "Programmers don't just program." Comment.     
   In your comment, make so use of the known value of how much time programmers actually spend programming each day.
3. "The most important 'technology' is people." Comment.    
   In your comment, make so use of the relative speed required for a humna or a static code analysis tool to assess code written in some changed and updated version of JAVA.
4. Inspections
   - Name 2 software project artifacts that can be inspect.
   - Defined "perspective-based inspections". 
     - For each of your 2 kinds of artifacts, define 2 different perspectives for inspecting that artifact. 
     - Offer an example of what might be learned via inspection for each of these 2\*2=4 prespectives. 
5. "Anonymous planning poker is an ego-less method for prioritizing tasks". Explain.     Ensure your explanation defines "planning poker" and "anonymous planning poker".
6. For the game tic-tac-toe (also known as naughts-and crosses), describe 4 classes (using CRC cards)
   - Start by defining that "C" and "R" and "C" is short form).
7. List and define the five best practices  as stated by the LINUX foundation.
   - For each, give an example of something that helps or hurts each practice
8. Using a feature map notations, draw an example product line
   - Describe two different products from that product line
   - What are cross-tree constraint in  and why do they made product generation fundamentally harder?
9. Jack Diederich in [Stop Writing Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0) lists an anti-pattern
   (an indicator of a poor class design)
  - State that anti-patterns.
  - How would you fix it?
  - In Diederich's experience, what is the effect on the code
    of implementing that fix?
10. Branching
   - What is branching?
   - Describe the git flow branch model
   - Describe the trunk-based   brach model
     - Distinguish this model from git flow
   - For each style of branching
   - Describe one style of project development that might benefit most from that style. Justify your answer
11. Licenses
   - Why does the Apache foundation prefer the Apache License over the MIT license?  [Hint][https://choosealicense.com/).
